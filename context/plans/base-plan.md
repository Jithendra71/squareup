## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Week 1)

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Install Node.js and npm (if not installed)

# Create new React Native project
npx react-native init SplitwiseClone
cd SplitwiseClone
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Navigation
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

# Firebase
npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth @react-native-firebase/firestore @react-native-firebase/storage

# State Management (simple & lightweight)

# UI Components
npm install react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons

# Forms
npm install react-hook-form

# Date handling
npm install date-fns

# Image handling
npm install react-native-image-picker
```

#### Step 3: Firebase Project Setup
1. Create Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Authentication (Email & Google)
3. Create Firestore database (start in test mode)
4. Enable Storage
5. Download `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
6. Configure Firebase in the app

#### Step 4: Project Structure
```
src/
  components/
    common/        # Buttons, inputs, cards
    expenses/      # Expense-related components
    groups/        # Group-related components
  screens/
    auth/          # Login, Signup
    dashboard/     # Home screen
    groups/        # Group screens
    expenses/      # Expense screens
    profile/       # User profile
  navigation/      # Navigation setup
  store/           # Zustand state
  services/
    firebase/      # Firebase functions
  utils/           # Helper functions
  constants/       # Colors, categories
```

### Phase 2: Authentication (Week 2)

#### Tasks:
1. Create Login & Signup screens

3. Set up auth state with Zustand
4. Profile setup for new users
5. Basic error handling

#### Key Files:
- `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/auth/SignupScreen.tsx`
- `src/services/firebase/auth.ts`
- `src/store/authStore.ts`

3. Error handling
4. Test with friends
5. Fix bugs
6. Set up Firestore security rules

## Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Group members can read/write group data
    match /groups/{groupId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
                     request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
    }

    // Expenses - only group members can access
    match /expenses/{expenseId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null &&
                               request.auth.uid == resource.data.createdBy;
    }

    // Settlements - only group members
    match /settlements/{settlementId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Estimated Costs

Since this is for personal use with friends:
- **Firebase Spark Plan (Free)**: Should be sufficient for 10-20 users
- Includes: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day, 1GB storage
- Only upgrade to Blaze (pay-as-you-go) if you exceed free tier

---

## Optional Future Features

You can add these later if needed:
- Receipt image attachments
- Push notifications
- Recurring expenses (monthly rent)
- Expense categories with icons
- Dark mode
- Monthly summaries/reports
- QR code for quick group joining

---

## Getting Started

1. Follow Phase 1 to set up React Native project
2. Create Firebase project and configure
3. Build features phase by phase
4. Test with friends after Phase 6
5. Polish and deploy
